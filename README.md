**Introduction**

The goal for this project was to practice using intermediate level CSS and HTML to create a website form. Since I took my time with the foundations portion of the Odin Project, I had a lot of confidence moving into the intermediate HTML/CSS section of the main JS path. I've dabbled with Grid, and various styling attributes that we learned in this section in my previous projects, but I found, however, that I could still use more practice! 

I decided to go with a art/video game theme for this project that ties in with some computer-based artwork I've created in the past. 

**Functionality**

Works like a simple sign-up form. There are validations included for certain elements like email, name, and passwords. The hero image has a frosted glass like effect that fades away when hovering over it. The pages makes use mostly of viewport units so the page will scale depending on the browser size.

**Process**
This project wasn't terribly difficult, but it gave me more trouble than I anticipated. I found myself going back to the documentation often to make sure I'm making correct use of CSS positioning, and I generally found it frustrating to properly align, scale, and position certain elements at first.

The first iteration of this page was actually quite different. It had a different color scheme and a different hero image on the page. I'm somewhat of a perfectionist with visual styling (I am an artist afterall), so I ended up scrapping the theme and restarting anew with a different hero image. 

Before the change, I wanted the background color of the header to lineup with the background color of the input forms. I could get close, but upon adjusting the browser size, it didn't always lineup properly and I found myself positioning elements more than I would have liked. 

With the new theme, I found it easier to properly position elements and be satisfied with the overall look. 

**Conclusion**
I'm satisfied with the page, but I definitely need to practice CSS more. Might be time to power through some freecodecamp! As always, I will come back to this in the future to see how I can improve things.
